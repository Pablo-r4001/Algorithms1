Percolation PROBLEM

N by N grid - sites

Sites
	Open
	Blocked

Full site
	connected to an open site on top row
		CHAIN NEIGHBORING (left, right, up, down)
	the system percolates if ther is a full site in the bottom row.
		Percolates if there is a full site in the bottom row

PROBLEM
 
	PRobability of percolation
	researchers are interested in the following question:
		SITES are set independently to be OPEN with PROB P
		Blocked with PROB 1-P
		PRobability system percolates?
		when P = 0 system doess not percolate
		Wen P = 1 System percolates

		Try to get percolation treshold p*
